duplicity-front is a front end to the duplicity backup utility \

Typically, all options need to be specified every time duplicity is run, \
including the full source and target paths as well as which files to exclude (or \
include), and other possible options.  This front to duplicity allows for these \
common options to be specified in a YAML config file.

An example YAML configuration file is provided in the Github repository and \
should be used as a reference.  This program will parse the YAML file and make \
sure it is sane before proceeding, but it is always advisable to first use the \
'--dry-run' option to ensure that nothing unexpected happens before making \
permanent changes.
